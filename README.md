## Description

This repository contains the back end for an e-commerce site. I have configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. It allows the user to:

- To add your database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
- To connect to a database using Sequelize
- To enter schema and seed commands
- You are able to search, create, update, and delete data in my database

## Installation

After copying the repository please run “npm install” to install the inquirer package.
The app uses:

- [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)

- [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages.

- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to store sensitive data (MySQL username, password, and database name) using environment variables through.


## Usage

Run `npm run seed` to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes. Then run the server `npm run start`.
